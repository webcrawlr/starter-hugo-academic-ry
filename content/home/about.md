I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Purdue University, pursuing a PhD degree under Dr. [Z. Berkay Celik](https://beerkay.github.io/).  I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from California State University East Bay.  My research interests cover machine learning, computer vision, and security, as well as the intersection of those topics in domains such as autonomous vehicle security.
